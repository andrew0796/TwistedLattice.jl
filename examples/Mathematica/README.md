## Reading and Using Lattices in Mathematica
Included here is a mathematica notebook with some code for looking at lattices generated by `TwistedLattice`

If the datafile was created with SWMR enabled, which it most likely was, you will likely have to use the Julia script `convertfiles.jl` to copy the SWMR-enabled files to ones without SWMR enabled. You can use the command line to do this in the following way
```
julia convertfiles.jl -s SUFFIX -d DIRECTORY object1 object2 ... objectN
```
where `-s SUFFIX` is optional and changes the suffix of the newly created files so that they become `fileSUFFIX.h5` (the default suffix is `"_non_SWMR"`), and `-d DIRECTORY` is also optional and specifies a directory to put the new files in, if it is relative then it will be relative to the path of the files themselves. The objects then passed are either files or directories with files in them that you want converted. For example, the sample data here was actually generated using
```
julia convertfiles.jl -s -d ../Mathematica/ ../cooling/SU3_24_6_6_6_twists_14_23_seed_1.h5
```
followed by renaming the resultant file.
